# shop-pyth.
This is for a shop management system with inventory and sales management
features in-built and carries an analytics platform.

### Setup
```SQL
create database shop;
use shop;
create user 'virtualrahul'@'localhost' identified by 'password'
grant all privileges on shop.* to 'virtualrahul'@'localhost';
```

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createcachetable
python manage.py runserver
```

#### Errors
* You might get error in createcachetable.
    * Comment out code in front/__init__py and re-run, then remove comments and
runserver

### Sample usage
* Goto /front
    * Fill out the form
    * Hitting submit shows item ids (lookout for'em)
        * Note these!
You have added stock for the first time now. Let's conduct a sale.

* Goto /front/sale
    * Type customer info. If the customer is re-visiting, keying in phone number
    should fill his name and optional email-id. Phone number is important
    * Now key in the item-id. Currently this is manual, but actually would be
    happening by a bar/QR code generator
    * Enter length
    * Hit submit to generate bill
    * You can always use the "Add items" option for more items

### TODO
* Make a landing page
* Beautify bill generation
* Make page for analytics purpose
* Integrate a bar-code generator
* Integrate a bar code-reader

### Bug
* db_cache is used to maintain counters for ID generation in tables. The incr()
    method for cached value sale resets timer.
    * Looks like it's a bug in django
    * **HACK** Replaced incr with a set()
